### HA-Current
Home Assistant Current Version 0.91.x

Hello all, I am delighted to share my Home Assistant project with you guys.
I've come a long way since the last update and I am sorry for the long delay
on the new setup as HA 0.89.x broke many of the stuff I had created before.

Well I have got it all fixed now and took a new take on the UI at the same
time. My goal was to make the app more "wife-friendly" and thus making it
simpeler to use was my main priority. In my old setup I used over 12 tabs in
the header which made navigation pretty much a pain. Now with the current
setup everything can be reached for from the main page using pop-up cards
and state change buttons. I will upload a video demonstrating all the functions
soon, however for now you will have to do with screens.

This time I have tried to make the UI as appealing as possible for tablets/
pc use as originally (and still is) this UI is created purely for smartphone
use. However currently I am planning to use it on my tablet as well.

I hope that you enjoy this new release of my lovelace setup. For screenshots

Disclaimer: I am not a developer, nor a programmer and have not worked in IT 
or whatsoever so the code may be a big mess (or maybe not), but I wouldn't 
know because I don't know what "good" code should look like. Any custom-component 
and/or cards are not made by me nor can I give support for it!

WARNING! DO NOT JUST COPY/PASTE MY SETUP AS YOU WILL GET ERRORS, 
YOU WILL GET FRUSTRATED AND I CAN NOT GIVE SUPPORT ON THAT. 
INSTEAD CREATE YOUR OWN! GOOD LUCK.
